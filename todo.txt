Testing - plot in paraview
One written as function, write tests
Implement matrices in numpy arrays like Jack said/ Figure out how to solve recursion problem
Figure out whether non-constant on the boundary is an issue
Check have fully implemented non-constant on boundary - A and n
Write as function
Finish different cases
