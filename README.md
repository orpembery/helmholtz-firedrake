# helmholtz-firedrake

## Summary ##
This code will (I hope) evolve into a small library of code to allow one to solve the Helmholtz equation using the Firedrake numerical PDE software.

Currently, one can specify a Helmholtz problem, or a stochastic Helmholtz problem on the unit square, and then solve it. One can also specify one of a range of stochastic coefficients.

## Documentation ##
Currently, it's a case of 'read the source code'. The documentation there should be fairly reasonable.
