Write tests for nontrapping coefficients
Fix \
Once firedrake have fixed bug that meant Julian's approach didn't work, rewrite the piecewise-constant stochastic code
Figure out whether non-constant on the boundary is an issue
Change mesh_size to make it work in 3-d
Change naming of *CoeffGenerator to *Coeff and update throughout
Check reference to monotonic in coeff definition
